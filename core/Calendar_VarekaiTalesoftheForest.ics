DESCRIPTION:<p>MontrÂŽal&#39\;s Cirque du Soleil returns to Tulsa with Varek
 ai. A reimagining of the Greek myth of Icarus\, in this version\, rather t
 han drowning in the sea after flying too close to the sun\, Icarus lands i
 n a kaleidoscopic forest populated by fantastical creatures. Meaning where
 ver in the gypsy language Romany\, Varekai pays tribute to the nomadic sou
 l\, to the spirit and art of the circus tradition\, and to the infinite pa
 ssion of those whose quest takes them along the path that leads to Varekai
 \, and features Cirque du Soleil&#39\;s trademark mind-boggling acrobatics
  and jaw-dropping feats.</p>\n\n\n200 S Denver Ave\nTulsa\, OK\n
