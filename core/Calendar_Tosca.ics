DESCRIPTION:<p>&ldquo\;Tosca&rdquo\;: the pinnacle of passion\, the epitome
  of emotion\, the drama deluxe. Giacomo Puccini&rsquo\;s grand tragic oper
 a about two mortal enemies both in pursuit of Floria Tosca has challenged 
 a century&rsquo\;s worth of singers to reach the highest levels of vocal t
 echnique and expression (without chewing up the scenery). Last season\, wh
 en Tulsa Opera\, newly under the direction of acclaimed composer Tobias Pi
 cker\, polled its audience for its most-wanted list\, &ldquo\;Tosca&rdquo\
 ;&nbsp\;took the top spot. For this production\, designed by the late Fren
 ch director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle\, both the conductor and the tenor make t
 heir American debuts\; add a Finnish baritone and a Russian soprano and yo
 u have the makings of an operatic feast.</p>\n\n\nPhone: 918.596.7122\n\n1
