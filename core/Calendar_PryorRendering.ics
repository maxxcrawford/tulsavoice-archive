DESCRIPTION:<p>It&rsquo\;s been a while since someone created a new musical
  set in our state&mdash\;73 years\, in fact. &ldquo\;Pryor Rendering&rdquo
 \; is a very different animal than Rodgers and Hammerstein&rsquo\;s &ldquo
 \;Oklahoma!&rdquo\;\, though they both originate in a story written by a n
 ative son.&nbsp\;</p>\n\n<p>Tulsan Gary Reed&rsquo\;s acclaimed novel by t
 he same name follows Charlie Hope\, a gay teenager coming of age in 1960s 
 Pryor in the &ldquo\;care&rdquo\; of a hard-drinking\, woman-chasing grand
 father and a Pentecostal mother&mdash\;not the strongest supports for a yo
 ung man who&rsquo\;s struggling to come out as well as grow up.&nbsp\;</p>
 \n<p>Adapted for the stage by Shawn Churchman of the University of Oklahom
 a\, with an elegaic country/bluegrass musical score by Frank Schiro\, and 
 directed by Stephen Nachamie (whose show &ldquo\;She Loves Me&rdquo\; was 
 recently on Broadway)\, &ldquo\;Pryor Rendering&rdquo\; is a co-production
  of American Theatre Company and the Oklahoma City Repertory Theatre (City
 Rep).&nbsp\;</p>\n\n<p>If musicals about Oklahoma are rare\, such a collab
 oration is maybe even rarer. According to ATC&rsquo\;s Richard Ellis\, &ld
 quo\;as far as we know\, there&rsquo\;s never been anything like two major
  theater companies in two cities combining to produce a world-premiere mus
 ical.&rdquo\;&nbsp\;</p>\n\n\nPhone: 918.596.7122\n\n110 E. 2nd St.\nTulsa
