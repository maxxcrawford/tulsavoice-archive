  </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Pachyderm Facts</p>\n\n<p>Just like humans the Car
 son & Barnes Circus elephants take daily showers\, although unlike most of
  us they really get the royal treatment. They get to lie down and get scru
 bbed cleaned by their loved handlers. It takes approximately 500 gallons o
 f water and a gallon of special soap just to give one elephant their daily
  bath. The majestic pachyderms are bathed with a soap that helps their nat
 urally tough skin. Pressured water is used to help them achieve a spa like
  cleansing! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see an elephant’s 
 bath!!!</p>\n\n\nPhone: 5807437292\n\n2160 S. Garnett Rd.\nTulsa\, OK\n741
