DESCRIPTION:<p>On February 21\, 2020\, you will be transported to lively Ne
 w Orleans at the newly renovated Tulsa Club Hotel\, where a sting of nosta
 lgia welcomes you as you enter into the glamour of an Art Deco past. A fun
  filled evening of dinner\, dancing and live auction excitement awaits you
 .</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>For over twenty-six years\, New Hope has b
 een working in Oklahoma to end the generational cycle of incarceration by 
 providing after-school programming and summer camps for children with a fa
 mily member in prison.New Hope is doing transformational work for children
  in our community!  Last year\, they served more than 750 youth\, and beli
 eve there are more children who could benefit from their programming. But 
 in order for them to do so\, additional funds are needed. Funds raised at 
 Mardi Gras will help New Hope hire more staff\, purchase new books\, and s
 upport the new Parent Connection Prison Literacy and Visitation Program.</
