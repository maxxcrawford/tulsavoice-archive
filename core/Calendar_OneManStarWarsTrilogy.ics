DESCRIPTION:<p>Created and brought to life onstage by Canadian actor Charle
 s Ross\, One-Man Star Wars Trilogy is just what it sounds like &mdash\; a 
 live solo performance of the original trilogy of Star Wars movies (A New H
 ope\, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi). The multi-talented 
 Ross stuns audiences by single-handedly playing all the characters\, singi
 ng the music\, flying the ships\, fighting the battles and condensing the 
 Star Wars plots into just over 60 minutes of live entertainment.</p>\n\n\n
