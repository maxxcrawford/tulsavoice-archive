DESCRIPTION:<p>One woman&#39\;s interior world unravels in this video piece
  by Jil Guyon. The woman appears to be of a bygone era\, but her environme
 nt is stark and futuristic. As her movement becomes repetitive layers of c
 ostume begin to unravel. The result is like Kabuki set to electronic music
 .</p>\n\n\n307 E M.B. Brady St\nTulsa\, OK\n
