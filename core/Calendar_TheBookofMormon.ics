DESCRIPTION:<p><em>South Park</em> creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone&#39\
 ;s foul-mouthed satire of religion and first-world privilege finally comes
  to Tulsa. The winner of nine Tony Awards tells the story of two naÂ•ve Mor
 mon missionaries sent to Uganda to proselytize the Good News\, only to run
  into brutal warlords\, AIDS\, famine and general third-world malaise that
  collides with their sheltered\, upbeat view of the world. Cue the song-an
 d-dance. The Book of Mormon has been widely praised as one of the best and
  funniest musicals of all time.</p>\n\n\n110 E 2nd St\nTulsa\, OK\n
