DESCRIPTION:<p>Never a troupe to shy away from the dark side\, American The
 atre Company started its 48th&nbsp\;season with a sensational production o
 f the Tony Award-winning tragicomedy &ldquo\;Fun Home&rdquo\; and continue
 s with &ldquo\;A Steady Rain\,&rdquo\; a hard-boiled duologue&mdash\;like 
 a monologue\, but for a pair of actors&mdash\;about two Chicago police off
 icer friends (originally played on Broadway by Hugh Jackman and Daniel Cra
 ig) whose professional lives and personal loyalties come into harrowing co
 nflict when a domestic disturbance call goes horribly wrong. The playwrigh
 t\, Keith Huff\, was a writer for &ldquo\;House of Cards&rdquo\; and &ldqu
 o\;Mad Men\,&rdquo\; so he knows his way around gritty dialogue and storie
 s of corruption and lost dreams. The play is minimalist in design\, with t
 he two actors addressing each other and the audience in a downpour of word
 s as unrelenting as the rain in the title. Expect a tour de force from the
  two actors\, as well as challenging material with themes of addiction and
  violence.</p>\n\n\n110 E 2nd St\nTulsa\, OK\n
