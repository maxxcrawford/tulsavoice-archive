DESCRIPTION:<p>Capping its fifth year of creating conceptually rich\, socia
 lly engaged\, and artistically challenging dance\, Tulsa Modern Movement p
 resents the premiere of &ldquo\;Liquid Geography.&quot\;&nbsp\;Company dir
 ectors Ari Christopher and Alicia Chesser collaborated to choreograph the 
 10-dancer\, 75-minute show\, which features original music by Scott Bell. 
 Christopher explains\, &ldquo\;Alicia and I were interested in exploring t
 he forces of nature and the story of Persephone through a thematic\, even 
 abstract lens\, rather than a narrative one. This piece asks about change\
 , how it affects us on a personal and community level\, how we respond to 
 uncertainty\, and the degrees to which we have agency in those changes.&qu
