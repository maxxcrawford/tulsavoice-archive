DESCRIPTION:<p>On a trip to Brazil\, South Carolina native Clay Ross found 
 a kinship between the folkloric music he heard there and the straightforwa
 rd songs of his native Appalachia. He recorded an album to explore this re
 lationship and titled it &ldquo\;Matuto&rdquo\; after a Brazilian slang wo
 rd referring to a man from the backcountry. Ross gathered a handful of tal
 ented New York City musicians from the city&rsquo\;s jazz\, roots\, and wo
 rld music scenes to bring his sound to life. Matuto (the band) plays North
  American folk songs like &ldquo\;Home Sweet Home&rdquo\; and &ldquo\;John
  the Revelator&rdquo\; over the South American rhythms Maracatu\, Forr&oac
 ute\;\, and Coco\, and vice versa. Matuto makes the lines between these di
 vergent genres and the geographical distance between their homes blur and 
 fade away.</p>\n\n\n110 E 2nd St\nTulsa\, OK\n
