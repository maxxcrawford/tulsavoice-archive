DESCRIPTION:<p>There&rsquo\;s never been a better time for a story about a 
 young lady plotting the downfall of a fascistic leader. In this case\, it&
 rsquo\;s the story of Matilda\, the precocious heroine of Roald Dahl&rsquo
 \;s 1988 book of the same name\, who takes down bully after horrible bully
  at home and at school with clever pranks and mindbending powers (literall
 y: she&rsquo\;s telekinetic). A movie version of the story starring Danny 
 DeVito became a hit in 1996\, but when the Royal Shakespeare Company propo
 sed giving it a go in musical form in 2010\, it wasn&rsquo\;t expected to 
 be more than a bit of fun. In the hands of composer and lyricist Tim Minch
 in\, an Australian comic genius in the lineage of Cold War satirist Tom Le
 hrer\, it became a critical and commercial sensation. Need a dose-by-proxy
  of revolt against thug tactics? Matilda&rsquo\;s your girl. &mdash\;Alici
 a Chesser</p>\n\n\nTulsa\, OK\n
