DESCRIPTION:<p>Fractured Eye features original works by two Oklahoma dance 
 companies. Tulsa&#39\;s The Bell House presents Frame\, in which doors\, b
 lankets\, string and shafts of light become frames that impose on our view
  and capture the hidden narratives within various relationships. Space bey
 ond the frame becomes as important as what is within its borders in this p
 iece that is at once humorous\, sorrowful and challenging. OKC&#39\;s Perp
 etual Motion presents The Fault Line\, a multimedia performance featuring 
 film and aerial apparatuses and earthquakes as a metaphor for instability 
 and unpredictable life changes. The dancers continually construct and deco
 nstruct the environment around them.</p>\n\n\n110 E 2nd St\nTulsa\, OK\n
