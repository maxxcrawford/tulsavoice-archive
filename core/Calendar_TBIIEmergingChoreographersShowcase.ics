DESCRIPTION:Tulsa BalletÛªs 60th Anniversary season continues with an aval
 anche of glitter (the world premiere of ÛÏDorothy and the Prince of Oz\,
 Û Feb 10-12)\, a whoosh of feathers (ÛÏSwan Lake\,Û Mar 24-26)\, and a
  dose of cutting-edge wit and glamour (the Signature Series\, featuring wo
 rk by three young internationally praised dancemakers\, May 11-14). Wedged
  in among all that big-time action is a sliver of the future: the Emerging
  Choreographers Showcase\, a weekend of performances devoted to the newest
  in contemporary ballet. Gifted young choreographers Jennifer Archibald\, 
 Rodrigo Hermesmeyer\, and Arman Zazyan (the latter are dancers with Tulsa 
 Ballet\, the former is a notable rarity\, a woman in whatÛªs historically
  a manÛªs world) will create new works for Tulsa Ballet II\, the main com
 panyÛªs dynamite junior ensemble. Expect extreme intimacy\, risky physica
 lity\, and go-for-it boldness from choreographers and dancers alike.\n\nPh
