DESCRIPTION:<p>Attorney and writer Mary Kathryn Nagle has argued cases in i
 n federal courts and had her plays produced on stages from New York City t
 o the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. But never in Tulsa\, where she lives an
 d works. That all changes when Heller Theatre Co. presents her play &ldquo
 \;Sovereignty\,&rdquo\; which interweaves the story of Nagle&rsquo\;s own 
 family history (she&rsquo\;s a descendant of some of the Cherokee Nation&r
 squo\;s most prominent political and cultural leaders) with a present-day 
 tale of violations and reprisals.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href='http://www.th
