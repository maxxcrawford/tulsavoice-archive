DESCRIPTION:<p>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is based on the
  story of Joseph from the Bible's Book of Genesis. A Narrator opens the sh
 ow by introducing Joseph\, the dreamer. To hide what they have done\, Jose
 ph's jealous brothers tell Jacob that his beloved son has been killed by a
  wild animal. Joseph defies all odds to survive\, succeed\, and eventually
 \, forgive his brothers.<br /><br />\nThis Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice re
 imagining of one of the best-known narratives from the Book of Genesis was
  a sell-out attraction when TPT presented it during the holiday season in 
 2012.</p>\n\n\n110 East Second Street\nTulsa\, OK\n74103\n\n
