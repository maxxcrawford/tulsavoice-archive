DESCRIPTION:<p>On December 4\, 1956\, Carl Perkins and his band went into S
 un Studios in Memphis to cut some new tracks. To fatten the sound\, Sun ow
 ner Sam Phillips called in a then-unknown Jerry Lee Lewis to add some pian
 o. Shortly thereafter\, Elvis Presley stopped in to pay a visit and Johnny
  Cash\, who had been there just to watch Perkins record\, entered the stud
 io and the four began to jam on gospel songs and covering songs by Bill Mo
 nroe\, Gene Autry\, Ernest Tubb and Chuck Berry among others\, as well as 
 a few of their own songs. Fortunately\, engineer Jack Clement had the fore
 sight to keep the tapes rolling and this once-in-a-lifetime jam became kno
 wn as the Million Dollar Quartet\, based on a headline in the Memphis Pres
 s-Scimitar the next day.</p>\n\n<p>That day inspired this Tony Award-winni
 ng musical\, which features more of the four legends&#39\; hit songs. Sure
 ly\, there&#39\;ll be a whole lotta shakin&#39\; goin&#39\; on in Chapman 
 Music Hall during this run.</p>\n\n\n110 E 2nd St\nTulsa\, OK\n
