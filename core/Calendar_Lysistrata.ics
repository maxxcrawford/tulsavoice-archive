DESCRIPTION:<p>This is a play for anyone generally frustrated by everything
 .&nbsp\;</p>\n\n<p>For our titular heroine Lysistrata\, her frustration st
 ems from the interminable civil war between Sparta and Athens.&nbsp\;</p>
 \n<p>Director Machele Miller Dill\, who also teaches musical theater histo
 ry and literature at the University of Tulsa\, says she chose Aristophanes
 &rsquo\; Greek comedy because it&rsquo\;s classic\, but also political&mda
 sh\;and even feminist. &nbsp\;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo\;Lysistrata&rdquo\; opens 
 with a woman fed up\, and she knows she won&rsquo\;t be able to cook or se
 w her way out of this one. So\, she convinces all the women of Athens to t
 ake a holy oath to withhold sex from their husbands until the war ends. It
 &rsquo\;s not a &ldquo\;gentle&rdquo\; play\, but it is hilarious.&nbsp\;<
 /p>\n\n<p>&ldquo\;It&rsquo\;s tough for comedy to get the respect it deser
 ves\, but comedy can make you think just has hard as drama can\,&rdquo\; s
 aid Dill. She plans to bring 70s and 80s punk rock aesthetics into the pro
 duction\, with key fashion inspiration coming from Debbie Harry\, Joan Jet
 t\, and Chrissie Hynde.</p>\n\n<p>Dill believes theater can be a vehicle f
 or social change. She doesn&rsquo\;t want people to leave her production a
 nd forget what they just saw. &ldquo\;I really do believe that theater can
  change the world.&rdquo\;&nbsp\;</p>\n\n<p>And there are plenty of modern
  examples of women pulling a Lysistrata to negotiate for change: In 2002\,
  women for the Liberian Mass Action for Peace went on a sex strike that he
 lped\, along with other nonviolent demonstrations\, to end a 14-year-long 
 civil war. A similar strike played out in Togo in 2012. In Turkey\, women 
 stopped sleeping with their husbands until clean water became available. &
 ldquo\;They won&rsquo\;t be able to get into our bedrooms until the water 
 actually runs through the taps\,&rdquo\; one village woman said in 2001\, 
 according to CNN.</p>\n\n<p>Because it&rsquo\;s all about power: who has p
 ower\, and who really has power.</p>\n\n<p>Dill weaves a sort of linear th
 read when it comes to war\, sex\, and power: the war is about gaining powe
 r\, but sex is about power too\, and the women prove to be more powerful w
 hen they leverage it to ultimately stop the war. &nbsp\;</p>\n\n<p>Can we 
 call Aristophanes a feminist? It can be problematic to assign such words t
 o authors based on their work. What&rsquo\;s clear: &ldquo\;Lysistrata&rdq
 uo\; is about women claiming and utilizing their sexuality. Though\, much 
 internal conflict comes from other women in her cabal unhappy about also n
 ot getting laid. If there is a lesson\, I like to think it&rsquo\;s that e
 veryone has a power within. The struggle is figuring out how to organize a
 nd harness whatever that power may be.&nbsp\;</p>\n\n<p>Of course\, the &l
 dquo\;Lysistrata&rdquo\; scheme doesn&rsquo\;t truss out in 2017. But for 
 a play older than Christ\, it&rsquo\;s pretty radical. Add to that some ri
 pped fishnets and dramatic eyeliner&mdash\;shit\, I&rsquo\;m excited.</p>
 \n<p>If you plan to attend &ldquo\;Lysistrata\,&rdquo\; keep in mind that 
 this play\, while not exactly shocking\, is intended to be provoking.&nbsp
