DESCRIPTION:<p>He might be from Broken Arrow originally\, but Tulsa has no 
 qualms claiming JD McPherson as a native son\, and the love is evident eve
 ry time he comes to town. Blending old-school rock\, R&amp\;B and rockabil
 ly with a modern sensibility and razor-sharp songwriting chops\, it&rsquo\
 ;s possible his local roots are immaterial&mdash\;Tulsa just loves the guy
 &rsquo\;s music. All ages show.</p>\n\n\n423 North Main Street\nTulsa\, OK
