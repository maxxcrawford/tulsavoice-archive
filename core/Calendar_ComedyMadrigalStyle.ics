DESCRIPTION:<p>Madrigals were the most important and popular secular music 
 of the Italian Renaissance. The often humorous\, sometimes double entendre
 -laced songs dominated courts\, theaters and taverns across Europe in the 
 16th and 17th centuries. Tulsa&#39\;s long-time early music ensemble\, Pro
  Musica Tulsae will perform excerpts from Orazio Vecchi&#39\;s 1594 play L
 &#39\;amfiparnaso. The madrigal comedy style of theatrical performance enj
 oyed a brief but exceedingly popular reception in Italy just as the newest
  musical form\, the opera\, was gaining momentum.</p>\n\n\n501 S Cincinnat
