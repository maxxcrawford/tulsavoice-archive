DESCRIPTION:<p></p>\n\n<p class='p1'>Andrew Grams returns to Tulsa to guest
  conduct Tchaikovsky’s emotional Symphony No. 6 the “Pathétique.” This pro
 gram will also feature Tim McFadden (principal trumpet) and Celeste Frehne
 r (English horn) on Aaron Copland’s Quiet City\, a short atmospheric piece
  which has become one of Copland’s most performed works.  The program will
  close with Hindemith’s Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria vo
 n Weber. Based on four hand piano works by Weber\, which Hindemith and his
  wife often played\, this colorful work is a sketched series of movements 
 that remains perhaps Hindemith’s most popular work.</p>\n\n\nPhone: 918584
