DESCRIPTION:<p>There can never be enough tellings and retellings of what ha
 ppened to Black Wall Street in the 20th century\, not just in Tulsa\, but 
 also nationwide. Silence perpetuates abuse. When history books make the ev
 isceration of black affluence invisible\, that means it can remain unseen 
 when it happens today. There&rsquo\;s been a push in recent years to make 
 this story heard\, from Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey&rsquo\;s &ldquo\;Race Riot
  Suite&rdquo\; to Jennifer Latham&rsquo\;s hit young adult novel &ldquo\;D
 reamland Burning.&rdquo\; Singer and composer Alicia Hall Moran\, herself 
 the daughter of a black financier\, created this staged concert in collabo
 ration with her husband\, jazz pianist Jason Moran (artistic director of j
 azz at the Kennedy Center) and historian Gene Alexander Peters (co-directo
 r of the Slave Relic Museum in South Carolina). It&rsquo\;s a performance 
 piece featuring Moran\, a noted mezzo-soprano\, and six musicians in a wid
 e-ranging\, many-layered exploration of the past\, present\, and future of
  money and blackness\, drawing on sources including Black Enterprise Magaz
 ine from the 1980s\, studies of 18th-century New York\, and documents from
  the Tulsa Race Riot in 1921.</p>\n\n\n110 E 2nd St\nTulsa\, OK\n
