DESCRIPTION:<p>An evening of one-act plays written by the winners of the Tu
 lsa City-County Library&#39\;s 2014 Young People&#39\;s Creative Writing C
 ontest\, One-Act Play category. The plays\, written by young writers ages 
 10-18\, are directed by Michael Wright\, director of the Interdisciplinary
  Program in Creative Writing at the University of Tulsa. &ldquo\;The very 
 fact that the Tulsa Library creates an opportunity for young people to wri
 te theatre is phenomenal\, said Wright. Add to that the respect shown for 
 their work by the Tulsa Performing Arts Center Trust to have the pieces st
 aged\, and you&rsquo\;re looking at a genuine celebration of theatre and a
  new generation of theatre-makers. The pieces we&rsquo\;ve been privileged
  to work on range from out-and-out whimsy to quite serious. These short pl
 ays are full of joy about life and concerns for the quality of life. I fee
 l very fortunate to have a topnotch cast to work with\; we are reveling in
  the fun of bringing the plays to life.&rdquo\;</p>\n\n\nTulsa\, OK\n
