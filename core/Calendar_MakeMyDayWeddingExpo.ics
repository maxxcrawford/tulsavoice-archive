DESCRIPTION:<p>The Make My Day Wedding Expo was created by Tatum Pettrey\, 
 owner of Make My Day Wedding & Event Planning. Her goal was to create an e
 vent that truly connected brides with wedding professionals on a more inti
 mate level than just collecting business cards. An event that was an excit
 ing part of the wedding planning journey. </p>\n\n<p>We cap our vendors at
  60 and limit our ticket sales to ensure an intimate experience that will 
 allow brides to be confident in making wedding planning decisions. We focu
 s on the couples and the professionals. </p>\n\n<p>Our special guest is De
 siree Hartsock from The Bachelorette\, who will meet and mingle with the c
 ouples and answer questions\, plus her wedding dress line will be there! T
 here is a VIP brunch cocktail hour leading up to the expo! It is such a fu
 n and exciting environment. </p>\n\n<p>Visit mmdwe.com to learn more! </p>
