CATEGORIES:PERFORMING ARTS
DESCRIPTION:In the late 1980s\, the vibrant Los Angeles poetry scene gave v
 oice to a new wave of writers and spoken word artists. The essence of DonÕ
 t Be Shy represents one manÕs journey through the eclectic coffee houses a
 nd performance art venues that celebrated diversity and uncensored self-ex
 pression. This collection of poems navigates the existential and sometimes
  humorous landscape of love and longing\, social commentary and spiritual 
 awakening to arrive at an awareness shared by one who embraced the enigmat
 ic creative promise of the City of Angels.\n\n328 E 1st St\nTulsa\, OK\n
