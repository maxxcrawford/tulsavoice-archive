DESCRIPTION:Theatre Pops presents the Oklahoma debut of this smash Broadway
  hit. When Vanda arrives several hours late to her audition for a play bas
 ed on a nineteenth-century erotic novel\, the director\, Thomas\, is less 
 than impressed. But VandaÕs masterful performance flips the script on Thom
 asÕ expectations and turns the session into a tango for dominance between 
 actress and director\, woman and man. Hailed as Òseriously smart and very 
 funnyÓ by The New York Times\, Venus in Fur is a laugh-out-loud study of t
 he politics of sex and power thatÕs guaranteed to charm and mesmerize.\n\n
