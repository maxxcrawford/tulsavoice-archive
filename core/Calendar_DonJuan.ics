DESCRIPTION:Don Juan\n\nOriginal text by José Zorrilla\n\nAdapted and Direc
 ted by Tara Moses\n\n \n\nIn many countries around the world during Día de
  Muertos\, the Spanish romantic-phantasmagoric-religious drama Don Juan Te
 norio by Jose Zorrilla is performed. Don Juan tells the story of the arrog
 ant and frivolous Don Juan\, whose only interest in life is seducing women
  - with or without their consent. In this new play\, we view the classic 1
 6th-century story with our modern eyes as we change the narrative to refle
 ct agency\, accountability\, and the dangers of machismo culture. This riv
 eting new adaptation has sword fighting\, bolero dancing\, and restitution
  for Doña Inés and Doña Ana. The show contains simulated violence\, strong
  language\, gun shots\, sexual innuendos and may not be suitable for audie
 nces under the age of 13.\n\n \n\nPerformances by telatúlsa\n\nThis Tulsa
