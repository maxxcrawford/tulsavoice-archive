DESCRIPTION:<p>The winner of eight 2012 Tony Awards\, including Best Musica
 l\, &ldquo\;Once&rdquo\; charms with unvarnished sincerity. Called &ldquo\
 ;a play with music\,&rdquo\; the understated modern-day love story evolved
  from the film written and directed by John Carney.</p>\n\n<p>In 2004\, Ca
 rney was touring in the Czech Republic with bandmate and fellow Irishman G
 len Hansard when they met talented young pianist and guitarist Mark&eacute
 \;ta Irglov&aacute\;. Hansard and Irglov&aacute\; formed The Swell Season\
 , and two years later the couple wrote the score for (and starred in) Carn
 ey&rsquo\;s film &ldquo\;Once.&rdquo\; Hansard and Irglov&aacute\; are no 
 longer together as a real-life couple\, but almost a decade later\, The Sw
 ell Season still performs in concerts around the globe.</p>\n\n<p>The stag
 e version of &ldquo\;Once&rdquo\; stars Dani de Waal and Stuart Ward. The 
 entire cast sings and plays instruments\, and they create a party atmosphe
 re in the theater even before the performance begins. Evoking an Irish pub
  setting\, the &ldquo\;Once&rdquo\; musicians play Irish folk tunes at an 
 onstage bar\, which is part of the set. Adult audience members are invited
  to come onto the stage pre-show and between acts to purchase drinks.</p>
