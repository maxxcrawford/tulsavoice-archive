DESCRIPTION:<h3>In the six short years since its establishment in 2012\, Ma
 lpaso Dance Company has already become one of the most sought-after Cuban 
 dance companies with a growing international profile\, as the company cont
 inues to take the American dance world by storm.  “Surely\, Malpaso\, with
  its fluid\, sexy athleticism\, can put the lie to the old saw that contem
 porary dance is too cerebral to be fun to watch.” (Miami New Times)  “Malp
 aso’s Dancers were exceptional.” (LA Times)  An Associate Company of Joyce
  Theater Productions\, Malpaso — together with The Joyce— has commissioned
  original works from a number of prominent North American choreographers\,
  and\, as a means of highlighting Cuban choreographers\, Malpaso has also 
 recently presented world-premiers by Cuban company members.</h3>\n\n\nPhon
