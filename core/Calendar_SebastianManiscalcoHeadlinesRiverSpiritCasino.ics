DESCRIPTION:<p>Fresh off a wildly successful\, two-year-plus run on his Sta
 y Hungry Tour\, Billboard’s inaugural Comedian of the Year Sebastian Manis
 calco is back with the You Bother Me tour\, which is currently set to visi
 t 12 cities in the U.S. and Canada throughout its fall run.</p>\n\n<p> </p
 >\n\n<p>Touted as ‘the comedian’s comedian” by People\, Maniscalco finds h
 imself “at the vanguard of a live comedy revolution” according to Pollstar
 . And the man “NBC Nightly News” called “comedy’s new superstar” is showin
 g no signs of stopping as he revealed the new tour during a visit to CBS’ 
 “The Talk” today.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>In addition to stops in high-profi
 le cities such as Boston\, Charlotte and Montreal\, the new tour will also
  have the Chicago native returning to the Windy City for a performance at 
 the famed United Center in Chicago. Tickets and VIP packages for You Bothe
 r Me tour dates are on sale now. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>“There’s nothing l
 ike going to a live show and seeing it in real life\,” Maniscalco says in 
 a recent interview with Forbes\, who named him as one of the Top 10 highes
 t-grossing comedians in the world in both 2017 and 2018. “Is there a comed
 y bubble that’s going to pop soon? Yet to be seen\, but as I’ve been in th
 is business\, it has gotten progressively better each year and I don’t see
  it slowing down.”</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Not only has the star power of Ma
 niscalco rocketed upward in the past few years thanks to shows described b
 y Billboard as ‘devastatingly full force comedy\,” but also due to his hig
 h energy Netflix Original special – Stay Hungry - streaming now. The speci
 al\, which was taped over a span of five sold-out shows at the legendary R
 adio City Music Hall\, had Maniscalco playing for a total of 28\,312 long-
 time fans and early believers in his unique comedic voice.</p>\n\n<p> </p>
 \n<p>Vulture recently said of the entertainer’s journey to success\, “Mani
 scalco\, without a breakout TV or film role\, built a tremendous fan base 
 the old-fashioned way: one joke at a time\, one audience at the time.” Alt
 hough he may not have started his career in film\, Maniscalco’s loyal fans
  will continue to see more acting roles from him with a performance opposi
 te Robert DeNiro\, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci in Martin Scorcese’s The Irishm
 an on Netflix this fall.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Visit: https://tickets.rive
