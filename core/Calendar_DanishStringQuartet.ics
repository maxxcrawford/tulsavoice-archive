DESCRIPTION:Without their instruments\, the three Danes and one Norwegian w
 ho make up the Danish String Quartet could easily be mistaken for an indie
  band. We are simply your friendly neighborhood string quartet with above 
 average amounts of beard\, they concede on their website. Their program at
  the PAC will include Bart&mdash\;k's Quartet No. 1\, Nielsen's Quartet in
  F Major\, Op. 44\, and some traditional Scandinavian folk music.\n\n110 E
