DESCRIPTION:<h3>Praised for his “excellent” and “precisely attuned” perform
 ances by the New York Times\, percussionist Ian Rosenbaum has developed a 
 musical breadth far beyond his years. He made his Kennedy Center debut in 
 2009 and later that year garnered a special prize created for him at the S
 alzburg International Marimba Competition. Rosenbaum joined the Chamber Mu
 sic Society of Lincoln Center in 2012 as only the second percussionist sel
 ected in the Society’s history.  Memory Palace is an hour-long immersive m
 usical narrative built around Christopher Cerrone’s evocative work of the 
 same name. Through electro-acoustic soundscapes\, visual projections\, and
  a fluid juxtaposing of unexpected techniques and found\, built\, and trad
 itional instruments\, works by five American composers are interwoven seam
 lessly to explore new\, expressive possibilities for solo percussion.</h3>
