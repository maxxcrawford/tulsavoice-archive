DESCRIPTION:<h3>Since its beginnings in the late 1990s\, the Hot Club of Co
 wtown’s star has continued to rise as its reputation for jaw-dropping virt
 uosity and unforgettable live shows has become the band’s global brand. La
 uded for its “down-home melodies and exuberant improvisation” (<em>The Tim
 es</em>\, London)\, the Hot Club has always woven a combination of seeming
 ly disparate styles together to its own magical effect\, setting up camp “
 at that crossroads where country meets jazz and chases the blues away” (<e
 m>The Independent</em>). The Hot Club of Cowtown has toured extensively wo
 rldwide for over twenty years\, both on its own and with artists including
  Bob Dylan\, Willie Nelson\, Gatemouth Brown\, the Avett Brothers\, Dan Hi
 cks\, Bryan Ferry\, Roxy Music\, the Squirrel Nut Zippers\, the Mavericks\
 , the Dustbowl Revival\, and others. (Over 21 only)</h3>\n\n\nPhone: 918-2
