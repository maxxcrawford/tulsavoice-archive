DESCRIPTION:Tulsa Symphony performs Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 6 in its e
 ntirety. The symphony is sometimes referred to as the Tragische for its br
 utal final movement\, in which soaring melody changes drastically into ago
 ny and darkness. Ironically\, the symphony was written in a very happy tim
 e in Mahler's life\; he had just married and become a father\, and his sec
 ond daughter was born during the symphony's composition. Mahler's wife Alm
 a would later identify the brutality in the piece with the tragedies that 
 befell Mahler in the years after the symphony's premier performance\, lead
 ing up to the composer's death just five years later.\n\n110 E 2nd St\nTul
