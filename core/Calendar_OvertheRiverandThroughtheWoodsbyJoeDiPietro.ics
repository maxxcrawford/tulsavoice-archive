 n Broken Arrow.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>The title of the play <em>Over the R
 iver and Through the Woods </em>reminds you of a song you sing around Than
 ksgiving and Christmas\, bringing back memories of family get-togethers du
 ring happy times. The love of family is the theme that runs throughout thi
 s warm-hearted comedy. Nick is a single\, Italian-American guy from New Je
 rsey. His parents retired and moved to Florida. That doesn't mean his fami
 ly isn't still in Jersey. In fact\, he sees both sets of his grandparents 
 every Sunday for dinner. These dinners are governed by the three “F’s” – F
 amily\, Faith and Food. This is routine until he has to tell them that he'
 s been offered a dream job. The job he's been waiting for—marketing execut
 ive—would take him away from his beloved\, but annoying\, grandparents. He
  tells them. The news doesn't sit so well. Thus begins a series of schemes
  to keep Nick around. How could he betray his family's love to move to Sea
 ttle\, for a job\, wonder his grandparents? Well\, Frank\, Aida\, Nunzio a
 nd Emma do their level best\, and that includes bringing to dinner the lov
 ely—and single—Caitlin O'Hare as bait…we won't give the ending away here.<
