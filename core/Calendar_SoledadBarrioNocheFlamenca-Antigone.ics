DESCRIPTION:<p>Founded in 1993 by Mart&rsquo\;n Santangelo and his wife\, B
 essie Award-winning dancer Soledad Barrio\, Noche Flamenca is one of the m
 ost celebrated flamenco groups in the world. With equal emphasis on the th
 ree aspects of flamenco&mdash\;word\, music and movement&mdash\;and a dedi
 cation to the intense passion and emotion of the form\, Noche Flamenca has
  captivated audiences worldwide. The company will perform its own flamenco
  adaptation of Sophocles&#39\; &quot\;Antigone.&quot\; The&nbsp\;adaptatio
 n was conceived when Santangelo saw a production of &quot\;Antigone&quot\;
  and was struck by the modern relevance of the play&#39\;s central battle 
 between a disenfranchised individual and the governing authority.</p>\n\n<
 p>Performances at the Tulsa Performing Arts Center&#39\;s John H. Williams
  Theater are March 31-April 1 at 7 p.m.</p>\n\n\n110 E 2nd St\nTulsa\, OK
