DESCRIPTION:<p>What a fine time for a good look at the mythologies of power
 . Andrew Lloyd Webber&rsquo\;s 1978 musical &ldquo\;Evita&rdquo\; follows 
 the life and death of actress Eva Per&oacute\;n\, the first lady of Argent
 ina from 1946&ndash\;1952\, a near-saint to her constituents and an icon i
 n a world obsessed with rags-to-riches narratives. She died at 33\, with h
 er profound political influence among the poor of her country inseparable 
 from her carefully-tended celebrity status. Patti LuPone immortalized her 
 on Broadway\, Madonna on film. With Karlena Riggs and John Orsulak as the 
 Per&oacute\;ns and Sean Patrick Rooney as the narrator\, Che\, Theatre Tul
 sa tries Evita&rsquo\;s story on for size under the direction of The Unive
 rsity of Tulsa&rsquo\;s Machele Miller Dill as part of a season of classic
  musicals. The first British musical ever to win a Tony Award\, it&rsquo\;
 s an epic show in true Webber style\, featuring the anthemic &ldquo\;Don&r
 squo\;t Cry for Me\, Argentina\,&rdquo\; &ldquo\;You Must Love Me\,&rdquo\
 ; and some useful meditations on the complex relationship between fame and
  public service.</p>\n\n\n110 E 2nd St\nTulsa\, OK\n
