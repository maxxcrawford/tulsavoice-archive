DESCRIPTION:<p>&ldquo\;Mr. Burns: A Post-Electric Play&rdquo\; opens with a
  group of survivors in the wake of an apocalyptic disaster. Alone in the w
 oods\, they piece together the plot of The Simpsons episode &ldquo\;Cape F
 eare&rdquo\; from memory. Over three acts\, &ldquo\;Mr. Burns&rdquo\; show
 s how this version of The Simpsons and other snippets of pop culture (comm
 ercials\, jingles\, pop songs\, etc.) become the foundation for a new cult
 ural mythology.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo\;It shows how media changes the way we vi
 ew things over time\, and how time changes the way we view those things\,&
 rdquo\; director Meghan Hurley said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo\;Donald Trump isn&rs
 quo\;t the first president we&rsquo\;ve had who was famous for something o
 ther than politics before he was elected\,&rdquo\; she added. &ldquo\;The 
 current state of affairs shows how much media shapes our lives.&rdquo\;</p
 >\n\n<p>&ldquo\;It also shows how in times of crisis people always turn to
  art. No matter what happens\, the worst possible things happen\, and peop
 le always turn back to art. It&rsquo\;s the thing that keeps us going\,&rd
 quo\; Hurley said. &ldquo\;You can turn tragedy into something that become
 s a form of art.&rdquo\;</p>\n\n\n230 E. 1st St.\nTulsa\, OK\n
