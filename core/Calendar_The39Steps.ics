DESCRIPTION:<p>Alfred Hitchcock&#39\;s 1935 spy thriller gets twisted in th
 is spoof presented by Theatre Tulsa in which a chance encounter leads to a
  man being hunted down by a mysterious organization. Chris Williams plays 
 Richard Hannay\, the dashing hero\, Laura Skoch plays all three of Hannay&
 #39\;s romantic interests\, and Robert Yound and Andy Axewell play every o
 ther character in the script&mdash\;around 100 of them in total. This will
  ensure some absurdity\, with actors performing quick changes and even por
 traying multiple characters at once.</p>\n\n<p>Performances at the Tulsa P
 erforming Arts Center&#39\;s Liddy&nbsp\;Doenges Theatre are March 26-28 a
 t 8 p.m.</p>\n\n\n110 E 2nd St\nTulsa\, OK\n
