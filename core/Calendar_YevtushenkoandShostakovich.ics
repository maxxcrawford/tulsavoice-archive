DESCRIPTION:<p>Yevgeny Yevtushenko\, the celebrated Russian poet and distin
 guished professor of literature at the University of Tulsa\, died on April
  1 of this year. To celebrate his life and legacy\, Tulsa Signature Sympho
 ny will perform &ldquo\;The Execution of Stepan Razin&rdquo\; (1964)\, a c
 ollaborative work between the poet and Dimitri Shostakovich.</p>\n\n<p>A f
 ollow-up to their 1962 collaboration that denounced antisemitism&mdash\;Sh
 ostakovich&rsquo\;s Symphony No. 13\, set to Yevtushenko&rsquo\;s libretto
  &ldquo\;Babi Yara&rdquo\; and five other poems&mdash\;&ldquo\;Stepan Razi
 n&rdquo\; looks further back in Russian history at the eponymous Cossack l
 eader who was executed for leading an uprising against the Tsarist regime 
 in 1671.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian cantata for solo bass\, male and female cho
 rus\, and orchestra\, is both grand and brutal&mdash\;an accurate depictio
 n of a man beheaded for revolting against the Tsars. Yevtushenko will long
  be remembered for standing up to powerful leaders\, fighting them with hi
 s words. This act of defiance is perfectly represented in &ldquo\;Stepan R
 azin\,&rdquo\; as the entire chorus sings near the end: &ldquo\;Not for no
 thing! Not for nothing!&rdquo\;</p>\n\n<p>Two other Russian works will be 
 performed the same night: Glazunov&rsquo\;s&nbsp\;&ldquo\;Stenka Razim&rdq
 uo\; and Borodin&rsquo\;s &ldquo\;Prince Igor: Polovtsian Dances.&rdquo\;<
