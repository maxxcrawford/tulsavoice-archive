DESCRIPTION:<p>The Playhouse Tulsa takes a modern approach at Harper Lee&#3
 9\;s classic. &quot\;The scenic design represents Maycomb\, Alabama\, in 
 the play\,&quot\;&nbsp\;Playhouse founder and director Courtneay Sanders 
 explained. &quot\;But is nondescript enough that it could easily be any t
 own. We have infused the piece with music\, some of which is sung a cappel
 la by a black female chorus\, allowing the audience to observe the juxtapo
 sition of cultures within this small community. The ensemble actors remain
  on stage throughout the play\, and several actors play multiple roles\, w
 hich they change before the audience&#39\;s eyes. The actors\, like the a
 udience\, are constant witnesses to every event taking place within their 
 community...events that will dictate their future. It is left to them to e
 ither take action against injustice\, or accept the consequences. Our goal
  is to further reveal the emotional depth and genuine heart of this poigna
 nt story.&quot\;</p>\n\n\n110 E. 2nd St.\nTulsa\, OK\n74103\n\n
