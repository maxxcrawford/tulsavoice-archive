DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Based on the life of &ldquo\;Berlin&rsquo\;s favorit
 e transvestite&rdquo\; Charlotte von Mahlsdorf\, &ldquo\;I Am My Own Wife&
 rdquo\; is first and foremost a survival story.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Doug Wr
 ight wrote the script after lengthy conversations he had with Mahlsdorf\, 
 then 65\, in the early 1990s. &ldquo\;I Am My Own Wife&rdquo\; premiered i
 n Chicago in 2002 and\, after the Broadway production in 2004\, earned Wri
 ght a Pulitzer Prize. Wright is also known for the American-British-German
  period film &ldquo\;Quills&rdquo\; and Disney&rsquo\;s &ldquo\;The Little
  Mermaid&rdquo\; on Broadway.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo\;She was a living history l
 esson\, this woman\,&rdquo\; said Lyric Theatre of Oklahoma Artistic Direc
 tor Michael Baron\, who is directing the Tulsa show. &ldquo\;There&rsquo\;
 s not many people that survived the Nazis and the East Germans and came ou
 t of the other side of the [Berlin] Wall intact.&rdquo\;</p>\n\n<p>Matthew
  Alvin Brown\, Tulsa Project Theatre&rsquo\;s artistic director\, stars in
  the role of Mahlsdorf. He also plays 30 other characters\, including SS o
 fficers\, Mahlsdorf&rsquo\;s lesbian aunt\, and even the playwright&mdash\
 ;all with the perfect amount of comic relief for a true story about a tran
 swoman dodging the Gestapo and Stasi.</p>\n\n\n110 E. 2nd St.\nTulsa\, OK
